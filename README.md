# PictureProcessing

A java application with numerous classes for processing pictures. These classes are called filters and make use of
pixel by pixel editing of an image using the BufferedImage class in Java.

The filters are as follows:
1) Blend
2) Blur
3) Change Brightness
4) Colour Scale
5) Flip
6) Grayscale
7) Invert
8) PixelArt
9) Rotation by 90, 180 and 270 degrees

All return an edited BufferedImage and take in an input of a BufferedImage except Blend, which requires two photos
in order to perform its purpose.
